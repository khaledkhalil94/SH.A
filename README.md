# Project SH.A

I started out this project as a re-design for my academy's website but it wasn't accepted because I'm still a student and I'm fine with that.

Anyway, so I decided to make this a long-time personal project and to apply most of whatever I learn to it sooner or later so wish me goodluck!

So far I have created the main page it's very primitive and in Arabic, check out the to-do list for features that I will work on adding to it.

Also, I only had resources from the official website so not much high-quality stuff here.

Feel free to fork/commit to the project.
