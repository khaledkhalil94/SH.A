# About this project
SH.A is an open source *Content Management System* and a *Social Network* with a full functional user profile and a messaging system, it is a place where you can write your own stories and interact with other's, you can also follow other users you like and keep up with their posts,  activities and stories.

SH.A is a solo and original project that I've coded myself from scratch in pure PHP for the back end, and it relies heavily on [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com) for the front-end.
