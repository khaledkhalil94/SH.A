# Project SH.A

I started out this project as a re-design for my academy's website but it wasn't accepted because I'm still a student and I'm fine with that.

Anyway, so I decided to make this a long-time personal project and to apply most of whatever I learn to it sooner or later.

So far I have created the main page, it's very primitive and in Arabic, soon I will be working on re-designing the website and adding more features using different frameworks to it.
